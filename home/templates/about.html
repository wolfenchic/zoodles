            <p class="aboutParagraph">Hi!<br> Welcome to Zoodles.<br>I'm artist and designer Sara. I make unique and personalised paintings inspired by the imagination of children.
            <a href="#">The name portraits </a> are made with your choice of theme and the child's name. Wether they're obsessed with dinonsaurs or curious about the world under the sea we can create an orginal painting just for you.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="aboutParagraph">
             <a href="#">The dictionary animal prints</a> are designed to make learning fun! Pick a letter and an animal character that starts with the same letter. Customise your animal character with your imagination. If a child loves ballet, then I can put them all in tutu's! Or each animal could be a member of the circus. Your imagination guides how fun your image can be!</p>
